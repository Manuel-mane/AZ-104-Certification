# Expire Data Based on Age inn Azure Blob Storage

## Scenario

In the scenario for this hands-on lab, I am taking the role of the web admin for an online shopping site. The holidays are coming, so I anticipate holiday themed items
becoming popular in the store. My plan to showcase these items on the homepage, in which a web app retrieves the photos for these items from an Azure Storage account. 
After the holiday season, I don't want to keep these images, and the storage costs are too significant. I must find a way to automatically delete these photos after 30
days.
