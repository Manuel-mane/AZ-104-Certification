# Perform Bulk Azure AD Operations

Azure Active Directory (AD) is often a critical component in many cloud-based Azure solutions. With Azure AD you have a centralized identity and access management platform, which helps for much more than simply storing user details and credentials. In this hands-on lab, I walk through bulk operations that can be performed within the Azure Portal, to help streamline the management of user accounts and security groups.
